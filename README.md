# 👋 Hey, I’m Shaun

Full-stack engineer focused on clean architecture, modern tooling, and building systems that scale — from dev automation to creative tools.

## 🧠 What I Do

I build with **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Java**, **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Docker**, with an eye for developer experience and maintainability. I prefer monorepos, versioned flows, and clean interfaces that *just work*.
