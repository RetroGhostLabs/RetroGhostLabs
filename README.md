# 👋 Hey, I'm Shaun

Solo developer & content creator at RetroGhostLabs building indie games and sharing AI-accelerated development workflows. I make games, create YouTube content about developer productivity, and release open-source templates for AI-assisted development.

## 🎮 What I Do

I build **games**, create **content**, and design **AI-powered workflows** that let solo developers move fast without burning out. My work focuses on practical systems: local LLM infrastructure, dual-AI development setups, and knowledge management for rapid iteration.

## 🕹️ Current Projects

### 🎮 Electorate
*In Active Development*

Turn-based political strategy game with procedural elements.
- **Platform:** PC (Steam target)
- **Engine:** Unity
- **Timeline:** 11-month development cycle (currently Week 3)
- **Tech:** C# + Unity, AI-generated assets, data-driven design

### 🐶 Pooping Pugs: Unleashed
*Concept/Prototyping Stage*

Comedic mini-game side project for creative breaks.
- Exploring 3D modeling with AI tools (Meshy.ai)
- Roblox prototype → Unity rebuild strategy

---

### 🎥 YouTube: RetroGhostLabs
Creating content for developers who want to build faster with AI:
- **AI Workflow Engineering** - Local + cloud LLM combinations
- **Solo Dev Systems** - Real project dev logs and debugging sessions
- **Tools & Setup Reviews** - Obsidian, IDEs, automation scripts
- **Template Releases** - Vault setups, prompt libraries, workflow automation

**Production Stack:** Obsidian for planning, Final Cut Pro for editing, OBS for recording

---

### ⚡ Specter LLM Server
Local GPU-accelerated LLM inference infrastructure for cost-effective AI development.
- **Purpose:** Replace expensive cloud APIs with local inference
- **Hardware:** NVIDIA RTX 4080 SUPER, 128GB RAM
- **Performance:** 100-130 tok/s on 7B-13B models
- **Savings:** ~$1,500-$3,300 annually vs. cloud APIs
- **Stack:** Ollama runtime, 15+ optimized models, Docker

This powers my entire AI-assisted development workflow without API costs.

---

### 🛠️ Development Infrastructure & Dotfiles
Sophisticated multi-machine development environment with heavy automation:
- **Dual-AI Setup:** Cline (IDE plugin) + Claude CLI working in harmony
- **Auto-Detection:** Automatically loads framework-specific rules (React, Unity, FastAPI, etc.)
- **Memory Bank:** Shared context across AI tools for consistent assistance
- **One-Command Init:** Makefile-driven project setup and environment config

Coming soon: Public dotfiles repo with templates and setup scripts.

## 📦 Templates & Resources

This repository will include open-source templates and resources from my YouTube channel:

- **Obsidian Vault Templates** - PARA + Zettelkasten hybrid setups
- **AI Prompt Libraries** - Game design, YouTube planning, development workflows
- **Game Design Documents** - Structure and templates for design docs
- **Workflow Automation Scripts** - Bash/Python scripts for common dev tasks
- **IDE Configurations** - JetBrains settings and AI integration configs

*More resources coming as YouTube content is released.*

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Game Development:**
- Unity (primary), Godot (exploring)
- C#, JetBrains Rider
- AI art tools (Midjourney, Meshy.ai) for rapid asset creation

**AI Development:**
- Claude CLI, Cline, ChatGPT, Ollama
- Local LLM inference (self-hosted)
- Dual-AI workflow automation

**Backend & Infrastructure:**
- TypeScript, Node.js, Python
- Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Git-driven development

**Content & Knowledge:**
- Obsidian (20+ plugins, PARA + Zettelkasten)
- Final Cut Pro, OBS Studio
- Markdown-first documentation

---

## 🧩 The Philosophy

**Build Fast, Iterate Faster**
Heavy AI assistance for acceleration. Prototype first, polish later. Ship working code over perfect code.

**Self-Hosted > Cloud Dependencies**
Local LLM server saves thousands annually. No rate limits, no API costs, full control over infrastructure.

**Document Everything**
Markdown-first docs that feed back into AI tools for better context. Everything version controlled.

**Playful & Scrappy**
Humor + tech + nostalgia. Slightly chaotic but organized underneath. Creative experimentation encouraged.

## 🎸 On the Side

When I'm not coding or recording:
- Writing music and sculpting tone chains on guitar/bass
- Tuning smart home setups to behave properly
- Exploring retro tech and creative storytelling experiments
