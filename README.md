# 👋 Hey, I'm Shaun

Game developer & content creator at RetroGhostLabs building indie games and sharing workflows for ADHD-friendly productivity. I design games, create YouTube content about Obsidian and AI workflows, and build tools that help neurodivergent creators stay organized and productive.

## 🎮 What I Do

I make **games**, create **content**, and build **AI-powered workflows** using CLI tools and Obsidian. My work centers on practical systems that work *with* ADHD brains, not against them — from game design to video planning to personal knowledge management.

## 🕹️ Current Projects

### 🎮 Electrate
*In Development*
A game project exploring [brief description of Electrate's core concept/genre].

### 🐶 Pug Game
*In Development*
A game featuring [brief description of Pug game's concept/theme].

### 🎥 YouTube Content
Creating videos and tutorials focused on:
- **ADHD-friendly workflows** for creative work and game dev
- **Obsidian** power-user tips, vault setups, and AI integrations
- **AI-assisted workflows** for content creation, game design, and project management
- Behind-the-scenes game development and design process

### 🧠 LogicFlows.ai Engine *(Open Source - On Deck)*
Evolving my visual logic builder into an open-source workflow engine.
- Originally a full-stack LLM-powered flow builder
- Pivoting to a CLI-first, modular engine for prompt chains and logic flows
- Designed for developers who prefer terminal workflows over web UIs
- Built with the lessons learned from integrating AI into daily creative work

---

## 💻 What I Work With

- **Game Dev:**
  [Game engines/frameworks you use - Unity, Godot, etc.]

- **Content Creation:**
  Obsidian, CLI AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.), OBS, video editing tools

- **Development:**
  TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Bash, Git, Docker

- **Workflow Stack:**
  Obsidian + AI integrations, CLI-first tools, automation scripts, knowledge graphs

## 🧩 The Philosophy

I used to build separate web apps for everything — music stats, idea tracking, flow builders. Then AI + Obsidian happened.

Now I've realized: **most of what I built can be done better with a great CLI AI and a well-organized Obsidian vault.** Game design docs? Obsidian. YouTube planning? Obsidian + AI. Personal knowledge base? Obsidian.

I'm focused on building things that *need* to be built (like games), and using smart workflows for everything else.

## 🎸 On the Side

When I'm not coding or recording:
- Writing music or sculpting tone chains on my Tone Master Pro
- Tuning smart home setups to behave properly
- Organizing my Obsidian vault like it's sacred work
